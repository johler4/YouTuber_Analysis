# YouTuber_Analysis
Analysis of top 995 YouTuber data

## Project:
Today we are going to use the available data to assist us with our new idea of starting a YouTube channel! Utilizing our knowledge of analyzing, filtering, and visualizing data, we are going to try to figure out if there is a specific idea or category of videos that we should focus on for our channel. Things that we should take into consideration are: fan-base sizes, channel growth-rates, moneys earned, outreach/collaboration possibilities, and anything else we may stumble accross during our research phase that might affect our decision of what kinds of videos to make.

Things we are going to explore:
- YouTube categories
- Moneys earned
- Related Channels
- Subscribers
- Location
